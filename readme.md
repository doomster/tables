				<p class="text-sm-left">This project started as a exercise, in order to bring a rusty programmer back to life. The project is based on 2 basic principles: <br> <b>A)</b> To be based only on php/mysql/bootstrap. No custom Javascript is used. <br> <b>B)</b> not to save any user data. All variables used are session variables, and when you Disconnect ,session is destroyed. <br><br>
				Have fun! </p>
